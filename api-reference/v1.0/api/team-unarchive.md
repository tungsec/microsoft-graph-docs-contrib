# Unarchive team

Namespace: microsoft.graph



Restore an archived [team](../resources/team.md). This API restores users' ability to send messages and edit the team, abiding by tenant and team settings. A Team is archived using the [archive](team-archive.md) API.

Unarchiving is an async operation. A team is unarchived once the async operation completes successfully, which might occur subsequent to a response from this API.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

This API supports admin permissions. Global admins and Microsoft Teams service admins can access teams that they aren't a member of.

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | TeamSettings.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | TeamSettings.ReadWrite.Group, TeamSettings.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

> [!NOTE]
> - The TeamSettings.ReadWrite.Group permission uses [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).
> - The Group.ReadWrite.All and Directory.ReadWrite.All permissions are supported only for backward compatibility. We recommend that you update your solutions to use an alternative permission listed in the previous table and avoid using these permissions going forward.
